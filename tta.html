        <h2> Brief History of Electric Power </h2>

                Thomas Edison's first electric power plant generated 110-volt direct current (DC)<br>  for lighting and varable-speed machinery in nearby buildings. But efficient transmission of power over long distances requires higher 
               <br> voltage was to use a "genset" -a DC motor driving a DC generator.<br>
                That's two rotating machines, with four windings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then Nikola Tesla inventer the alternating current (AC) induction
                motor and transformer. With constant AC frequency, an induction motor's speed cannot vary, but it is cheaper and more durable 
                than a DC motor. Since a transformer has no moving parts and just two windings, it is cheaper and more durable than a DC genset. So at ehe dawn of the 20th century, AC won "the war of the currents."

                But not forever. In the middle of the 20th Century, computer began consuming progressively more DC power.Then came the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and the voltage-source converter (VSC). A VSC can make variable-frequency AC wihich runs induction motors at variable speed, and it easily transforms DC.

                DC power, computer control, and the internet are helping the power
                grid accept variable renewable resources like wind and solar. And
                they are improving electrical distribution systems on campuses, in
                neighborhoods, and in buildings. With local energy generation and
                storage, distribution systems are evolving into robust "microgrids."
